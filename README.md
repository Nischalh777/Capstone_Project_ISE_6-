```3.  **Edit the file to be correct.** The easiest thing to do is to delete everything from `<<<<<<< HEAD` to `>>>>>>> ...` and then paste in the complete, correct `README.md` content that we created earlier. Make it look exactly how you want the final version to be. There should be no `<<<`, `===`, or `>>>` characters left in the file.
